Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Unlock the iron box in the boiler room – it may contain the missing saw blade.

Plan to achieve the sub-task  
1. Inspect the iron box; this should give us the opportunity to enter its 4-digit code.  
2. Use the hint from paper 1 (“π”) → 3.141 → code 3141 (dot omitted as instructed) to unlock it.

Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small subtask:
Open the iron box in the boiler room.

Reasoning:
• Paper 1 shows a big π, hinting at the digits 3 . 141.  
• The iron box asks for 4 digits with a dot between the 1st and 2nd digit (3.141).  
• Ignoring the dot, the required 4-digit input should be 3141.

Action sequence to achieve the subtask:
1. click(iron box) – examine it and, when prompted, enter 3141 to try unlocking it.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Check the state of the oil-drum-with-hose so we know how to feed gas/oil to the boiler.

How to achieve it:
1. Leave the boiler room and go back to the stair scene (the oil drum is there).  
2. Once in the stair scene, click the oil drum to inspect it and learn what can be done with the hose.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Retrieve the gas can behind the iron fence.

Rationale  
The only thing separating us from the gas can is the rusty “old bar”. We now possess a complete hacksaw, ideal for cutting metal. Sawing through the bar should let us reach or remove it, giving access to the gas can.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Examine and collect the roll of film found in the bed close-up scene.

Why: We just discovered the film and haven’t looked at it yet. Picking it up will tell us what it is and likely add it to the bag for later use (e.g., to decode the strange lock that has a “film-shaped pattern”).

How to do it: From the current scene (bed close-up) simply click on the film.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Obtain the screwdriver from the cabinet, so we can later use it to remove the screw that seals the plug in the dormitory.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Unscrew the plug in the dormitory so we can remove it and see what’s behind it.

How to achieve:
1. Leave the cabinet close-up and return to the dormitory.  
2. Use the screwdriver on the plug.

You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Retrieve the loosened plug.

Reasoning: After loosening the screw, the plug is now ready to be taken. Picking it up may allow us to power something later.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Read the note in the dormitory to obtain its full content and any hidden clues.  
Rationale: The cabinet’s 4-digit lock and other puzzles still need numeric hints. The dormitory paper (showing “ZZ, 40, AZ, X0”) is likely such a hint, so examining it closely is the next logical small step.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Install the spare lever into the power-distribution box so the second circuit is energized.

Plan to achieve it
1. Move from the dormitory → room on the right.  
2. From the room on the right → distribution box close-up.  
3. Apply the lever to the power distribution box.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Restore full power by inserting the spare lever into the power-distribution box.

Why: The box is missing a lever. Inserting ours should energize more circuits, probably unlocking other electric locks (e.g., the safety door or combination devices).

How to achieve it:
1. Move from our current scene “room on the right” to “distribution box close-up” (they are directly connected).
2. Apply the lever in our bag to the “power distribution box”.

Immediate next action: move(distribution box close-up)

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Examine the silk painting in the control room to look for hidden clues or a mechanism.

Reasoning  
The painting is described as “looking strange in that place” and “there might be something hidden inside.” Investigating it could reveal a compartment, a code, or an item that will help with the control-room puzzles (e.g., powering the computer or opening Safety Door 4).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Check the silk painting for any hidden mechanism or clue. 

How to achieve: Click the silk painting to examine it more closely.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Pick up the duct tape from the cabinet.

Rationale: The computer in the control room has a broken wire; with duct tape and the plug in our bag we should be able to repair it later. First, we need to have the duct tape in our inventory.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small subtask:
Examine the computer in the control room more closely to understand what exactly is broken and what it needs for repair/power-up.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Reach the control room and try to repair the broken-wire computer (likely with the pickable plug and/or duct tape) so we can power it up and read the disks for further clues.

Plan to begin the sub-task  
1. Leave the current “room on the right” for the “initial room”.  
2. From there go to the “room on the left”.  
3. Enter the “control room”.  
4. Once beside the computer, try applying the pickable plug and then the duct tape, and finally click the computer to test it.

Immediate action (step 1/3 on the route)

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Repair and power-on the computer in the control room.

How to achieve:
1. From the current “initial room”, go to “room on the left”.  
2. Continue into “the control room”.  
3. Try to supply power: apply the pickable plug to the computer.  
4. If the wire is still damaged, use the duct tape to fix it.  
5. Once repaired, click the computer to see what data it contains.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Gain access to and inspect the computer in the control room (we may be able to repair it with the duct tape and/or plug, and perhaps read whatever is on the disks).

Plan to achieve the subtask  
1. From our current location (room on the left) move into “the control room.”  
2. Once inside, click the computer to see its current state; then we can decide whether to apply the duct tape or pickable plug.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Inspect the silk painting in the control room to see if anything is hidden behind or inside it.

How to achieve it:
1. Stay in the current scene (the control room).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Power up the computer.

How to achieve: connect the pickable plug you collected to the computer that is already repaired with duct tape.

- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small subtask: Obtain the knife so it can later be used to cut the barbed-wire–blocked vent pipe in the dormitory.

Plan to achieve the subtask:
1. While still in “the emergency exit,” pick up the knife.

Proposed_subtask: Next subtask  
Retrieve whatever is hidden inside the dormitory’s vent pipe (it is blocked by barbed-wire) – this may give us the missing disk or another clue.

Plan to achieve the subtask  
1. move(room on the left)        – leave the control room.  
2. move(initial room)            – step back to the hub.  
3. move(room on the right)       – enter the right-hand room.  
4. move(the dormitory)           – go into the dormitory.  
5. apply(wire cutter, vent pipe) – cut through the barbed wire and take the object inside.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Examine the computer again to learn details about the newly-revealed disk slot and find out what it still needs.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Retrieve the third disk that is probably hidden in the secret storage you just exposed behind the silk painting.

How to achieve it:
1. In the current scene (the control room) click the new interactable area revealed by cutting the painting – likely named “secret storage space” (or similar). This should let you look inside and pick up whatever is hidden there (hopefully disk 2).

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Get whatever is hidden inside the dormitory vent pipe.  
Why: The pipe is still blocked by barbed wire and we now own a wire cutter that can remove it. The object inside may be the third disk or another key item.

Plan to accomplish the sub-task
1. From the control room go to the room on the left.  
2. Go to the initial room.  
3. Go to the room on the right.  
4. Enter the dormitory.  
5. Apply the wire cutter to the vent pipe to cut the barbed wire and retrieve the object.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Retrieve the object hidden in the vent pipe of the dormitory.

Why: The dormitory’s “vent pipe” is blocked by barbed wire, and we now have a “wire cutter.” Cutting the wire should let us reach whatever is inside, likely giving us a new clue or item.

Plan / Actions
1. move(initial room) – go back to the central hub.  
2. move(room on the right) – enter the right room.  
3. move(the dormitory) – reach the dormitory.  
4. apply(wire cutter, vent pipe) – cut the barbed wire and take what’s inside.

This is a small, clear step toward uncovering a new item or hint.

Proposed_subtask: Next small subtask  
Retrieve whatever is stuck inside the dormitory’s vent pipe by cutting away the barbed-wire obstruction.

How to achieve it  
1. From the initial room, move to “room on the right”.  
2. Move from there into “the dormitory”.  
3. Apply the wire cutter to the vent pipe to remove the barbed wire and reach what’s inside.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Reach the dormitory so we can cut the barbed wire blocking the vent pipe with the wire cutter.

How to achieve:  
From the current scene (room on the right) move directly to “the dormitory,” which is adjacent.

Planned immediate action:

Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small subtask:
Open the blocked vent pipe and retrieve whatever is inside.

Plan to achieve it:
The vent pipe is blocked by barbed wire, and we have a wire cutter in our bag that can cut thin metal wires. Use the wire cutter on the vent pipe to remove the obstruction.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small subtask  
Develop the roll of film to reveal the hidden images, which may contain clues for the 7-digit “strange lock” password.

How to achieve it  
The blue liquid in your bag is likely a photographic developer. By combining it with the film you may obtain a developed negative or an actual photograph (perhaps still needing the photo paper afterwards). Start by trying to mix the film with the blue liquid.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Bring disk 2 to the computer in the control room (so we can insert it and see what happens).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Get disk 2 to the computer in the control room so we can insert it and see what happens.

Plan to achieve it:
1. Move from “initial room” → “room on the left”.
2. Move “room on the left” → “the control room”.
3. Apply disk 2 to the computer.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task  
Investigate the “door opened …” message by going to the boiler-room and checking Safety Door 2; it is probably the door that just unlocked.

Plan to achieve the sub-task  
1. Leave the control room → room on the left.  
2. From room on the left → initial room → stair → the boiler room.  
3. Click safety door 2 to see what is beyond it.

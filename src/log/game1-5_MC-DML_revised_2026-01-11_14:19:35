Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Extract some oil from the oil drum so it can be carried elsewhere or used to power/repair something later.

Plan  
The hose in the bag has round heads that can connect both ends. The oil drum description mentions a connection port, so attaching the hose should allow us to siphon or draw out oil. Therefore, try applying the hose to the oil drum.

Proposed_subtask: Proposed next sub-task  
Extract oil from the oil drum.

Rationale  
The oil drum has a “connection port” and we now possess a hose “with round head, could connect both ends of something.” The hose seems designed to attach to a port, allowing us to draw oil or route it elsewhere. Trying this interaction is straightforward and may yield oil or create a filled hose, which could be useful in the boiler room or for powering the fan later.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Assemble a functioning hacksaw.

Plan & Reasoning: We already have a hacksaw handle (missing its blade) and a separate saw blade in the bag. Combining them will give us a usable hacksaw, which will likely help us cut through metal objects (e.g., iron fence or other obstacles) later.

Proposed_subtask: Next subtask  
Learn what is required to unlock the electrically-controlled safety door in the boiler room.

Why  
Until we understand its locking mechanism (keypad, switch, fuse, etc.), we cannot choose the right tool or puzzle to solve.

How to achieve the subtask  
We are already in the boiler room, so simply examine the door.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Check the oil-drum-plus-hose setup to see if something new (e.g. a valve, free hose end, or a way to take it along) appeared after we attached the hose.

How to achieve it: simply examine the oil drum again.

Plan to accomplish the subtask:
1. move(Back to room on the right) – leave the close-up to return to the room.
2. click(safety door 1) – try the door; if the electricity we supplied opened a door, this should now respond.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Explore the cabinet for useful items or clues.

How to achieve: Move from the dormitory to the cabinet close-up and inspect its contents.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Collect the iodine bottle, which will later let us reveal hidden messages on the paper in the dormitory.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Reveal the hidden message on the white paper in the dormitory.

Plan to achieve the subtask  
Use the iodine from the bag, which is commonly employed to develop invisible ink, on the “paper” lying in the dormitory.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Obtain a screwdriver so we can later remove the screw that holds the plug in the dormitory.

Plan to achieve it:
1. We are already in “cabinet close-up”.
2. Simply click the screwdriver to pick it up.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Restore full power by installing the spare lever into the power distribution box.

How to achieve it:
1. move(Back to the dormitory) – leave the cabinet close-up.
2. move(Back to room on the right) – return to the room with the distribution box.
3. move(distribution box close-up) – zoom in to the box.
4. apply(lever, power distribution box) – insert the lever into the empty slot and switch it on.

This should energise circuits that are still unpowered, likely unlocking something else in the facility.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Remove the screw that fixes the plug so we can take or use the plug later.

Plan  
The plug is “sealed by a screw”, and we already have a screwdriver in the bag; therefore, use the screwdriver on the plug.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Collect the loosened plug so it can be used later to supply power where needed.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Restore full power by inserting the second lever into the power-distribution box.

How to achieve it
1. Leave the dormitory and return to the room on the right.
2. Move in for a close-up of the distribution box.
3. Apply the lever from our bag to the empty slot in the box; this should energize whatever circuit is still offline.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Proposed next subtask:
Install the spare lever onto the power distribution box to supply full electricity to the facility.

Plan to achieve it:
1. Move from “room on the right” to “distribution box close-up”.
2. Apply the lever from the bag to the power distribution box; this should seat the lever in the empty slot and activate additional circuits.

Immediate next action:

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Start exploring the still-unvisited “room on the left” to discover the new door that the lever may have unlocked or to find other useful items/hints.

How to achieve it
1. Leave the current “room on the right” and return to the “initial room”.
2. From the “initial room”, enter the “room on the left”.
3. Once inside, click on every newly listed interactable item to learn what’s there.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small subtask  
Subtask: Explore the (as-yet unvisited) control room to discover its interactable items and possible clues.

Plan to achieve it  
1. From the current scene “room on the left”, move straight to “the control room” (they are directly connected in the map).  
2. Once inside, observe the list of new interactable items that will appear.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Acquire the duct tape that is inside the cabinet.  
Rationale: Duct tape will likely help fix the broken computer wire (or other damaged wiring), letting us power-on the computer later. We’re already at “cabinet close-up,” so grabbing the tape is straightforward.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next Subtask: Try developing the blurry film.

Plan to achieve the subtask:
1. Use the strange blue liquid as a possible developing chemical on the film.
2. Craft the blue liquid with the film and see if it produces a developed image that could help with the 7-digit lock in the dormitory.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Obtain the numerical clues written on the “paper” in the dormitory, which are likely required to determine the 7-digit password for the strange lock.

Plan to achieve the subtask:
1. Click the “paper” lying in the dormitory to read its full contents.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Retrieve whatever is stuck inside the vent pipe in the dormitory.

Reasoning  
The pipe is blocked by barbed wire. Wrapping some duct-tape round your hand (or directly over the wire) should let you grab the hidden object without getting cut.

Please try other actions to take.; t-4: move(Back to the dormitory): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: the dormitory.; t-3: click(paper): Nothing happens after clicking on paper.; t-2: apply(duct tape, vent pipe): vent pipe indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. You may need to get rid of the barbed wire first to get the thing inside.; t-1: click(strange lock): Nothing happens after clicking on strange lock. You need to input the correct password according to the hint beside it.]
Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Head back to the control room so we can try repairing / powering-on the broken computer.

How to achieve it  
From the dormitory, follow the corridor back to the room on the right, then to the initial room, then to the room on the left, and finally into the control room. We can only take one step now, so we start by moving to the adjacent scene “room on the right”.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Repair the broken computer wire in the control room.

Why: The computer will probably reveal or process clues (e.g., disks 1 & 3) once it has power. We already have “duct tape”, a typical quick-fix for a broken cable.

How to achieve it:
1. Navigate from the current scene (room on the right) to the control room:
   • move(initial room)  
   • move(room on the left)  
   • move(the control room)
2. apply(duct tape, computer) to mend the wire.

If the duct-tape repair succeeds, the computer should turn on or at least become usable for the next steps.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Get the big fan in the initial room running.

Rationale: The fan is currently off and we have a “pickable plug” whose description says it can connect electrical devices to power. This is likely exactly what the fan needs. Getting the fan running may reveal new clues or open another path.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Reach the control room so we can attempt to repair the computer’s broken wire (likely with the duct tape).

Plan to achieve it:
1. From the initial room, move to “room on the left”.
2. From “room on the left”, move to “the control room”.
3. Once in the control room, try applying the duct tape to the computer cable.

Execute step 1 now.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Your previous actions and reward: [t-10: move(Back to the dormitory): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: the dormitory.; t-9: click(paper): Nothing happens after clicking on paper.; t-8: apply(duct tape, vent pipe): vent pipe indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. You may need to get rid of the barbed wire first to get the thing inside.; t-7: click(strange lock): Nothing happens after clicking on strange lock. You need to input the correct password according to the hint beside it.; t-6: move(Back to room on the right): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: room on the right.; t-5: move(Back to Initial room): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: initial room.; t-4: apply(pickable plug, fan): Nothing happens after you apply the tool.; t-3: move(Go to room on the left): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: room on the left.; t-2: move(Go to the control room): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: the control room.; t-1: apply(duct tape, computer): Action executed successfully. You have successfully applied duct tape to computer.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small subtask:
Power on the computer in the control room.

How to achieve it:
Attach the pickable plug in your bag to the computer so it can be connected to power.

Your previous actions and reward: [t-10: click(paper): Nothing happens after clicking on paper.; t-9: apply(duct tape, vent pipe): vent pipe indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. You may need to get rid of the barbed wire first to get the thing inside.; t-8: click(strange lock): Nothing happens after clicking on strange lock. You need to input the correct password according to the hint beside it.; t-7: move(Back to room on the right): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: room on the right.; t-6: move(Back to Initial room): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: initial room.; t-5: apply(pickable plug, fan): Nothing happens after you apply the tool.; t-4: move(Go to room on the left): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: room on the left.; t-3: move(Go to the control room): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: the control room.; t-2: apply(duct tape, computer): Action executed successfully. You have successfully applied duct tape to computer. You fixed the wire with duct tape. but the plug is still missing.; t-1: apply(pickable plug, computer): Action executed successfully. You have successfully applied pickable plug to computer. Now the computer is open. you can see 2 disk slots.]
Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Read the data stored on the disks via the powered-on computer. This will probably give new codes or clues for locked devices elsewhere.  

How to achieve  
We are already in the control room and the computer is now powered. Simply insert one of the disks into a slot. Start with disk 1.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Boot up the computer completely by filling its second disk slot.  
How to do it: Insert the remaining disk we carry (disk 1) into the computer, which has two disk slots and currently holds only disk 3.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Inspect the computer again to learn about the newly-revealed disk slot and any prompts/hints it shows.

How to achieve it:
1. Stay in the current scene (the control room).
2. click(computer) — this will display the computer’s current screen/state and let us find out what the third slot requires (very likely “disk 2” or other instructions).

Proposed_subtask: Proposed small subtask:
Retrieve whatever is hidden in the vent pipe of the dormitory by cutting away the barbed wire with the knife.

How to achieve it:
1. From the current scene (the emergency exit) follow the corridor back to the dormitory:
   a. move(Go to the control room)  ← emergency exit → control room  
   b. move(Back to room on the left)  
   c. move(Back to initial room)  
   d. move(Go to room on the right)  
   e. move(Go to the dormitory)
2. click(vent pipe) to examine it once more (optional, to confirm we’re at the right item).
3. apply(knife, vent pipe) – the knife should slice through the barbed wire and let us grab the object inside.

Immediate next action to start this subtask:

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Reveal whatever is hidden inside the suspicious silk painting in the control room.

Plan to achieve the sub-task  
1. Move(the control room) – the emergency exit connects directly to the control room.  
2. Apply(knife, silk painting) – cut the painting to see what is concealed.

Expected result  
The painting should open up, giving us the hidden item (likely another disk or a new clue).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Reveal the possible hidden item inside the silk painting in the control room (likely the missing disk) by cutting it open with the knife.

Plan to achieve the subtask:
1. Leave the emergency exit and go back to “the control room”.
2. Once in the control room, use the knife to cut the silk painting and check what is hidden.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Check whether the big silk painting in the control room hides the missing third disk (or any other item that helps the computer).

How to achieve it:
1. Move(the control room) – the emergency exit is directly connected to the control room.
2. Once inside, click(silk painting) to inspect it; if inspection shows fabric that can be cut, we can then apply(knife, silk painting) in a following step.

I will start with step 1: move(the control room).

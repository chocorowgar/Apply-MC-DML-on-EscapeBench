Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next small sub-task: Explore the “control device on pillar” area to see what equipment or clues are available there; this may provide a way to power devices or reach the hanging wire.

How to achieve it
1. From your current location (shelves region middle) walk to the adjacent scene “control device on pillar”.
2. Once there, examine any interactable items.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task: Collect the remaining paper piece lying here. It may finish the name-slot puzzle later.

Plan to achieve the sub-task:
1. Stay in the current scene (wash basin place).
2. Pick up the paper piece.

Plan to achieve it  
1. Move from the current “wash basin place” back to “shelves region middle” (they are directly connected).  
2. Apply the toilet plunger to the “messy wire wrapped on ceiling”; the long handle should allow you to hook the ring and pull it down.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Pull down the hanging ring on the “messy wire wrapped on ceiling” so it becomes reachable/usable.

Why  
The wire is currently out of reach; the long wooden-handled toilet plunger can act as an improvised hook/pole.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Explore the “shelves region table” area to discover any new items or clues.

Plan:
1. From the current location “shelves region overview”, move directly to “shelves region table” (they are adjacent on the map).
2. Once there, examine any interactable objects that appear.

Proposed_subtask: Proposed next sub-task  
Unlock the cabinet in the left hallway with the gold “bolt-sign” key you just found.  
Why: The key clearly matches the bolt symbol engraved on the cabinet’s lock, so opening that cabinet is the most direct way to progress and may yield new tools.

Plan to achieve the sub-task  
1. Move from “shelves region table” → “shelves region overview”.  
2. Move “shelves region overview” → “middle hallway”.  
3. Move “middle hallway” → “left hallway”.  
4. Apply the gold key with bolt sign to the cabinet key lock.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Unlock the cabinet in the left hallway with the “bolt-sign” gold key – it should reveal whatever is stored inside.

Plan to achieve  
1. From “shelves region overview” go to “middle hallway”.  
2. Continue to “warehouse leftside overview”, then “left hallway”.  
3. Apply the gold key with bolt sign to the cabinet key lock.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Unlock and open the cabinet in the left hallway (it has the same yellow bolt sign as the gold key we just found).  

Plan to achieve it  
1. From the current scene “middle hallway”, move to “warehouse leftside overview”.  
2. Move from “warehouse leftside overview” to “left hallway”.  
3. Apply the “gold key with bolt sign” to the “cabinet key lock” in the left hallway.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Proposed next sub-task: Collect the square key on the wall.

Rationale: We just noticed the square key in the current scene; picking it up may let us open locked lids later (e.g. the garbage bin). It is a simple, immediate action that advances progress.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Proposed next sub-task  
Open the locked garbage-bin lid; it may hide something useful.

Plan to achieve it  
1. Move(left back to warehouse leftside overview).  
2. Move(warehouse outside).  
3. Move(garbage disposal place).  
4. Apply(square key, green garbage bin) – the key description suggests it is meant “to open lid”.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task: Get to the garbage disposal place so we can try using the square key to unlock the green garbage bin’s lid (the key looks like it was made for that).  

Plan to achieve it  
1. From the current scene “left hallway”, walk back to “warehouse leftside overview”.  
2. From there go outside to “warehouse outside”, then on to “garbage disposal place”.  
3. Once at the garbage area, apply the square key to the green garbage bin.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Prepare a “sticky tennis ball” that can be tossed upward to pull the dagger out of the hydrant sign.

Why & plan  
• The dagger is currently out of reach.  
• Sticking blue tape around the tennis ball should let the ball adhere to the dagger so we can yank it down later.  
• First craft the sticky ball, then we will throw (apply) it at the dagger.

You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Collect the dagger that just fell from the sign so it can be used later.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Collect the paper piece ‘J’ that is now visible inside the opened garbage bin.

How to achieve:
1. Stay in the current scene (garbage disposal place).
2. Execute action: click(paper piece 'J') – this will pick it up and add it to our bag.

Expected outcome: We obtain the paper piece ‘J’, which we can later combine with the partially-filled name slot in the cabinet.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Head toward the shelves region table so we can inspect – and, if possible, open – the alarm clock (we may be able to loosen its screws with the dagger).

How to achieve it  
1. Leave the garbage disposal place for the warehouse outside.  
2. Continue through the warehouse left-side overview → middle hallway → shelves region overview → shelves region table.  
3. Once at the shelves region table, click the alarm clock, then try apply(dagger, alarm clock).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Explore the Office Door area to discover new interactable items (may yield clues or tools).

Plan to achieve the subtask:
1. Move from your current location (warehouse door corner) to middle hallway.
2. From middle hallway, move to office door overview.
3. Once there, examine any interactable items.

Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small sub-task
Open the alarm clock on the shelves-region table and see what’s inside. The clock has four screws; the dagger in our bag can serve as a makeshift screwdriver.

Plan to achieve it
1. Move from the current scene to the shelves-region table:
   garbage disposal place  → warehouse outside  → warehouse door corner  
   → middle hallway → shelves region overview → shelves region table.
2. Click the alarm clock to examine it closely.
3. Apply the dagger to the alarm clock to remove the four screws and open it.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task: Complete the blank name slot on the cabinet.

Reason:  
We picked up a small paper piece with the letter “J”. The cabinet’s name slot is “currently not fully filled”, implying that inserting the missing letter may unlock or reveal something. This is a quick, local action that may give us a new clue or item.

Plan to achieve it:
1. move(left hallway)   – the hallway is directly connected to our current scene.  
2. click(name slot)     – inspect it closely to understand how to insert the piece.  
3. apply(paper piece 'J', name slot) – place the “J” into the slot.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Explore the “boxes pile in hallway” to look for clues or items (possibly a 4-digit code for Jack’s cabinet).

Plan to achieve the sub-task  
1) move(warehouse leftside overview) – from the left hallway to warehouse leftside overview.  
2) move(middle hallway) – go into the middle hallway.  
3) move(boxes pile in hallway) – enter the scene with the piled boxes.  
4) click(boxes pile in hallway) – examine / search the pile.

This will finish the small sub-task and may yield the password or another useful object.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task: Explore the unexplored “shelves region left” area to see if it contains new items or clues.

Plan to achieve it:
1. From our current scene (“shelves region overview”), take the connecting path to “shelves region left”.
2. Once there, examine any newly revealed interactable objects.

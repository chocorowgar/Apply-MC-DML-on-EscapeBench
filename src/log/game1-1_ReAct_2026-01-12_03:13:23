Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Try to use the hammer handle as a makeshift knob to open the bathroom door.

How to achieve  
Since we’re already in the bedroom and the only interactable object here is the “bathroom door,” simply apply the hammer handle to that door. If it works, we’ll gain access to a new scene (the bathroom) to continue exploring.

Planned action  
apply(hammer handle, bathroom door)
Action: apply(hammer handle, bathroom door)
Reward: bathroom door indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. The door is locked and missing a handle, you cannot open without it.

Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task  
Explore the telephone-cabinet close-up to discover its interactable parts and any clues or items it contains.

How to achieve it  
We are already looking at the cabinet close-up, so simply examine the first visible object in it. A safe first step is to click the telephone itself; this will either show details of the phone or reveal additional interactables (drawers, notes, etc.).

Planned action  
click(telephone)

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Try to improvise a door handle so the bathroom door can be opened.

Plan:
1. Since we are already in the bedroom and the “bathroom door” is right here, use the hammer handle as a makeshift substitute for the missing door handle.

Immediate next game action:
apply(hammer handle, bathroom door)
Action: apply(hammer handle, bathroom door)
Reward: bathroom door indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. The door is locked and missing a handle, you cannot open without it.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Try to repair the mirror by inserting the first shard.

Plan to accomplish the subtask  
1. move(To the mirror close-up) – the mirror is directly reachable from the bathroom.  
2. apply(shard_1, mirror) – see if this shard fits into the broken mirror.

If it succeeds we can repeat the process with shard_2 next.
Action: move(To the mirror close-up)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: mirror close-up.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Investigate the suspicious study wall.

Reasoning: You’re already at the wall close-up, and the description (“A wall that seems not solid behind”) hints at something hidden. The next logical small step is to inspect it more closely.

Planned action: click(study wall)
Action: click(study wall)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on study wall. Maybe there's something hidden behind this wall, you have to break it.

Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Test whether the weak-sounding study wall can be broken open.

Plan to achieve it:
1. We are already at wall close-up, and “study wall” is interactable.
2. Try using the hammer handle as an improvised battering tool on the wall.

Action: apply(hammer handle, study wall)
Action: apply(hammer handle, study wall)
Reward: study wall indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. Maybe there's something hidden behind this wall, you have to break it.

- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Investigate the photos on the study wall for anything hidden behind them (e.g., another mirror shard or a clue).

Plan to achieve the subtask:
1. Move from the current “wall close-up” scene to the adjacent “photo close-up” scene.
2. Once there, click on each photo (photo_1, then photo_2) to see if anything is concealed behind them.

Next action:
move(To the photo close-up)

Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task  
Look for any hidden markings or text on the hanging photographs – they could contain the password for the toolbox or safe.

How to achieve it  
We are already in the “photo close-up” scene, and the flashlight in our bag is operational.  
Use it to illuminate the first photograph.

Planned action  
apply(flashlight, photo_1)
Action: apply(flashlight, photo_1)

Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task  
Unscrew the ventilation fan cover to see what is hidden inside.

Why  
The fan is held by four screws. We do not have a real screwdriver, but the flat mirror shards might work as an improvised flat-head. Opening the fan could yield the hammer head, a screwdriver, or some other useful item.

Plan to accomplish the sub-task  
1. From the current scene (wall close-up) move back to the study.  
2. Move from the study to the living room.  
3. Move from the living room to the bedroom.

Change to another scene: study.; t-8: move(To the wall close-up): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: wall close-up.; t-7: apply(hammer handle, study wall): study wall indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. Maybe there's something hidden behind this wall, you have to break it.; t-6: move(To the photo close-up): Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: photo close-up.; t-5: apply(flashlight, photo_1): Nothing happens after you apply the tool. Just an old photo, nothing of interest.; t-4: click(photo_1): Nothing happens after clicking on photo_1. Just an old photo, nothing of interest.; t-3: apply(flashlight, photo_2): Nothing happens after you apply the tool. Nothing unusual with this one.; t-2: move(Back to the wall close-up): Action executed successfully.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Start assembling the broken bathroom mirror by inserting one of the glass shards you’ve found (shard_3).  
How to achieve it:  
1. Move from the study → living room → bedroom → bathroom → mirror close-up (following the scene connections).  
2. Once at “mirror close-up”, apply shard_3 to the mirror.

First step toward this: move(living room)
Action: move(Back to the living room)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: living room.

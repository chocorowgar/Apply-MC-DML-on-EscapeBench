Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small sub-task  
Open the locked green garbage bin – it looks like it “needs a tool”, and we haven’t yet tried the chisel there. If we can pry the lid open we may find an item (possibly the key or something to help reach the dagger).

How to achieve it  
1. From the current scene “crane overview”, walk back to “warehouse outside”.  
2. From “warehouse outside”, walk to “garbage disposal place”.  
3. Apply the chisel to the green garbage bin to try to force the lid open.

Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small subtask  
Open the locked lid of the green garbage bin to see what is inside – it may contain an item useful for reaching the dagger or opening other locks later.

Plan to achieve it  
The bin is locked; the hammer in our bag is a sensible tool for smashing or prying its lock. We are already standing at the garbage disposal place, so we can immediately try the hammer on the bin.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task  
Explore the “control device on pillar” to learn what it does (it may operate the hanging wire or supply power).

How to achieve  
1. move(control device on pillar) – it is directly connected to the current scene “shelves region middle”.  
2. click(control device on pillar) – inspect/operate it once we arrive.
Action: move(Go to explore device on pillar)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: control device on pillar.

Proposed_subtask: Next small subtask: Unlock and open the cabinet in the left hallway.

Why: The cabinet’s lock bears the same yellow bolt sign that is on the gold key we just found, strongly suggesting the key fits it. Unlocking the cabinet may reveal new tools or clues.

How to achieve it:
1. From the current scene “middle hallway”, move to “warehouse leftside overview”.
2. From “warehouse leftside overview”, move to “left hallway”.
3. Apply the gold key with bolt sign to the cabinet key lock.

Planned action sequence:
move(warehouse leftside overview)
Action: move(Back to left side of warehouse)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: warehouse leftside overview.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small subtask:
Clear the garbage blocking the kitchen sink so we can see what’s at the bottom and (hopefully) open the cabinet under the sink.

Why this subtask?
• The sink is still blocked; once cleared we may discover new items or clues.
• We now possess a plunger, the obvious tool for unblocking a drain.
• Completing this may unlock further progress with the kitchen area.

How to achieve it:
1. From the bathroom, walk back to the bedroom.
2. From the bedroom, go to the living room.
3. From the living room, enter the dining room and kitchen.
4. Move to the sink close-up.
5. Apply the plunger to the garbage in the sink.

Next action (step 1 of the plan):
move(To the bedroom)
Action: move(To the bedroom)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: bedroom.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Unclog and clear the kitchen sink to see what is hidden at the bottom (there may be a useful item or clue).

Plan to achieve the subtask
1. From the living room, move to the “dining room and kitchen.”
2. From the dining room and kitchen, move to the “sink close-up.”
3. Apply the plunger in your bag to the “garbage” in the sink.

Expected result: The plunger should remove the clog/garbage, revealing whatever is in or under the sink and possibly unlocking access to the cabinet under the sink.

- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Pick up the screwdriver from the toolbox so it can later be used to remove the screws that hold the ventilation fan in place.

Plan to achieve the subtask:
1. We are already at “toolbox close-up”, so no movement is required.
2. Click on the screwdriver to take it.

Proposed next action:  
click(screwdriver)
Action: click(screwdriver)
Reward: Action executed successfully. You have just collected a screwdriver. It is put into your bag. You may craft something new with it and other things in the bag, or apply it in the future.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Open the ventilation fan cover to see what is hidden behind it.

Why  
The ventilation fan is fastened with four screws, and we now have a screwdriver. Whatever is behind the fan may give us a key or clue for the next locks.

Action plan  
1. move(bedroom) – from toolbox close-up back to the bedroom.  
2. move(bathroom) – enter the bathroom.  
3. move(ventilation fan close-up) – focus on the fan.  
4. apply(screwdriver, ventilation fan) – remove the screws and open the cover.

This completes the small sub-task.
Action: move(Back to the bedroom)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: bedroom.

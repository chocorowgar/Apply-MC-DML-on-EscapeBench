Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Investigate the cardboard box to look for useful items or clues.

Why  
The cardboard box is the only object in the bedroom that hasn’t been examined yet; it may contain the hammer head to pair with the handle, or other clues/passwords we still need (toolbox code, safe code, etc.).

Plan to achieve the sub-task  
1. Leave the current close-up to return to the bedroom.  
2. From the bedroom, move into the cardboard box close-up.  
3. Click the contents of the cardboard box to examine/collect whatever is inside.

Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task  
Unclog the kitchen sink to see what is hidden under the garbage.

Why  
The sink is still full of garbage and the plunger we just picked up is the obvious tool for clearing it. Removing the clog may reveal a new item or access to the cabinet under the sink.

Plan to achieve the sub-task  
1. move(dining room and kitchen) (from bedroom → dining room and kitchen)  
2. move(sink close-up) (in the kitchen)  
3. apply(plunger, garbage) (or apply(plunger, sink) if “garbage” isn’t clickable)

Expected outcome  
The garbage is sucked out, the bottom of the sink becomes visible, and any hidden item or passage (e.g., the cabinet_under_sink) is revealed for the next actions.

Proposed_subtask: Next small subtask: Clear the clogged sink to reveal what’s inside it.

Plan to achieve the subtask
1. Path: We are already in “dining room and kitchen”. From here move to its sub-scene “sink close-up”.
   move(To the sink close-up)
2. Use the plunger to clear the clogged drain/garbage.
   apply(plunger, garbage)

Expected result
Removing the garbage should let us see the bottom of the sink (and possibly expose the cabinet_under_sink) and may reveal a useful item or clue.

- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask  
Fit the mirror shards you’ve collected into the broken bathroom mirror. Restoring the mirror will probably reveal another clue or item.

Plan to achieve the subtask  
1. Locker close-up → study (parent scene)  
2. Study → living room  
3. Living room → bedroom  
4. Bedroom → bathroom  
5. Bathroom → mirror close-up  
6. Once at the mirror close-up, successively apply the shards in your bag (apply(shard_1, mirror), apply(shard_2, mirror), etc.).

Immediate next action (step 1/5)  
move(study)
Action: click(open locker doors)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on open locker doors. The lockers are empty. there's nothing useful inside.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Break open the suspicious wall in the study.

Why: The wall is described as “not solid behind,” and we now have a fully assembled hammer that can smash things. Breaking the wall may reveal new items or a hidden passage needed to progress.

Plan to achieve the sub-task
1. From the current locker close-up, move back to the study (adjacent in the map).
2. From the study, move to the wall close-up.
3. Apply the hammer to the “study wall” interactable item.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Closely investigate the suspicious wall in the study.

Rationale: The “study wall” description says, “A wall that seems not solid behind,” suggesting something is hidden there. To learn more (and possibly break through with the hammer), we should first zoom in on the wall.

Plan to achieve:
1. Move from the current scene “study” to its connected close-up scene “wall close-up.”

Proposed next action:
move(wall close-up)
Action: move(To the wall close-up)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: wall close-up.

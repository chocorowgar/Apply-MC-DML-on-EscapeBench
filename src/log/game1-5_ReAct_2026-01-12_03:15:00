Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Unlock the iron box to see what’s inside.

Reasoning: The paper showing π (pi = 3.141…) together with the hint about a dot between the 1st and 2nd digits strongly suggests the code “3·141,” which—without typing the dot—means 3141. Opening the box is likely to yield something useful (e.g., a saw blade or key).

Action to achieve the subtask:
click(iron box)
Action: apply(key 2, iron box)
Reward: Nothing happens after you apply the tool. You need to input the correct password. pay attention to why there's a dot between the digits.

Proposed_subtask: Next subtask  
Fill the empty gas can with fuel so it can later be poured into the boiler.

Why this subtask  
• The boiler explicitly needs gas to run.  
• We already possess an empty gas can.  
• There is an oil drum with a hose in the stair scene that can likely dispense fuel.

Plan to achieve it  
1. move(Back to Initial room) – return through the opened fence to the initial room.  
2. move(stair) – go down the stairs where the oil drum is located.  
3. apply(gas can, oil drum) – use the empty gas can on the oil drum to fill it with fuel.

(The apply step is the real action of this subtask; the preceding two moves just get us there.)

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Fuel the boiler so it can start operating.

Why: The boiler is labeled “--use gas--”. We now have a filled gas can, so putting the fuel in is the logical next step toward getting the boiler running and, perhaps, restoring power for the electrically-locked doors.

How to achieve it: apply(gas can, boiler)
Action: apply(gas can, boiler)
Reward: Action executed successfully. You have successfully applied gas can to boiler. You filled the boiler with oil. it's now running and you san see a lock on its control panel.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Reveal the hidden writing on the piece of paper in the dormitory.

How to achieve  
1. move(the dormitory) – go back to the dormitory scene.  
2. apply(iodine, paper) – brush the iodine onto the paper to develop the concealed text.

These two steps should expose whatever clue is written on the paper and likely advance us toward solving one of the cabinet locks or other puzzles.
Action: move(Back to the dormitory)

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Reveal the hidden writing on the white paper in the dormitory.

Reason: The paper’s text is invisible, and iodine is a classic reagent for developing hidden messages. Discovering what the paper says will likely give a clue for one of the locks.

Concrete step now:
apply(iodine, paper)
Action: apply(iodine, paper)
Reward: Action executed successfully. You have successfully applied iodine to paper. Some blue writings appeared on the paper -- zz, 40, az, x0.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.

Proposed_subtask: Proposed next sub-task  
Unlock the 4-digit combination lock in the dormitory cabinet (code very likely is 2451 from paper 3).

Why this sub-task  
• We have a fresh 4-digit hint “2451”.  
• The only remaining 4-digit lock is the cabinet’s combination lock.  
• Opening the cabinet will probably give us a new item or clue needed for later puzzles.

Plan / sequence of game actions  
1. From the control room move back to the room on the left.  
2. Move back to the initial room.  
3. Move to the room on the right.  
4. Move to the dormitory.  
5. Move to cabinet close-up.  
6. Click the combination lock (the game will ask for the 4-digit code).  
7. Enter 2451 to unlock it.

If the lock opens we’ll look inside the cabinet for new items.
Action: move(Back to room on the left)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: room on the left.

Power up / fix the computer in the control room so it can be used.

Plan to achieve the subtask  
The computer’s description says its wire is broken. We have a “pickable plug” in the bag that looks like something meant to restore a power connection. Try attaching (applying) the pickable plug to the computer.

Action  
apply(pickable plug, computer)
Action: apply(pickable plug, computer)
Reward: computer indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Develop the roll of film so we can see the hidden images and (hopefully) obtain a password clue.

Plan to achieve the subtask  
Photographic developing usually needs a chemical solution; the “strange blue liquid” we found is likely the developer. Therefore I’ll try combining (crafting) the film with the blue liquid.

Action  
craft(blue liquid, film)
Action: craft(blue liquid, photo paper)
Reward: Nothing happens after crafting these two things together. Please try other actions to take.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Try to open the electrically-controlled safety door in the control room (safety door 4) to see if it is now powered and can be opened.

Plan to achieve it
1. move(Go to the control room) – from the current “room on the left”.
2. click(safety door 4) – attempt to open or get feedback.

If the door opens we can explore the new area; if not, we’ll know another step is required.
Action: move(Go to the control room)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: the control room.

- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Open the cabinet in the dormitory with the 4-digit code “2451”.

Plan to achieve it
1. Walk from the control room to the cabinet close-up scene:
   control room → room on the left → initial room → room on the right → the dormitory → cabinet close-up.
2. Once in the cabinet close-up, click the combination lock to enter the code 2451 and open it.

First step toward the subtask
move(room on the left)
Action: click(silk painting)

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

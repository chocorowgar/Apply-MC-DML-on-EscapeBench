Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Restore electricity by operating the power-distribution box.

Rationale: The indicator light on the box is off; once we open/activate the box we may supply power to other electrical devices (e.g., safety doors, fan). We are already in its close-up view, so the next step is to interact with it.

Next action: click(power distribution box)
Action: click(power distribution box)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on power distribution box. Try to provide energy for the distribution box. maybe you can go to other places first...

How to achieve the sub-task:
1. Stay in the current scene (stair) where the oil drum is located.
2. Apply the empty gas can to the oil drum.

Planned game command:
apply(gas can, oil drum)
Action: apply(gas can, oil drum)

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Head toward the dormitory to inspect the room that may have just been unlocked.

Why: After turning on the second lever, the game said “a door is opened …”. The only unexplored, possibly locked area left is the dormitory, which lies beyond the room on the right. We need to get there and look around.

How to achieve this subtask (step-by-step plan)
1. From the stair, return to the initial room.
2. From the initial room, enter the room on the right.
3. From the room on the right, move into the dormitory.
4. Once inside, examine every new interactable item.

Immediate next action (step 1):

Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Explore the bed in the dormitory to look for any useful objects (e.g., a screwdriver for the plug, clues for the 7-digit lock, etc.).

Plan to achieve the subtask  
We are already in “the dormitory,” and the game map shows a direct link to “bed close-up,” so simply move into that close-up and inspect whatever is there.

Next action  
move(bed close-up)
Action: click(vent pipe)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on vent pipe. You may need to get rid of the barbed wire first to get the thing inside.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask
Obtain the disk lying on the bed.

Rationale
Collecting potential data-holding items is important for later puzzles. “disk 1” is visible and has not been picked up yet, so we should take it now.

Plan to achieve the subtask
While staying in the current scene (bed close-up), click on the disk.

Proposed next action
click(disk 1)
Action: click(disk 1)
Reward: Action executed successfully. You have just collected a disk 1. It is put into your bag. You may craft something new with it and other things in the bag, or apply it in the future.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Try to unlock the strange lock in the dormitory using the film.

Reasoning: The strange lock has a film-shaped pattern, suggesting the film in our bag might interact with it. We are currently at “bed close-up”, which is directly connected to “the dormitory”, so we should return there and attempt the application.

First action to start the subtask:
move(Back to the dormitory)

- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Acquire the loose plug so it can later be used to bring power somewhere.

How to achieve:
1. click(pickable plug) – now that its screw is loosened, this should add the plug to our inventory.

(Stay in the current scene; no movement needed.)
Action: click(pickable plug)
Reward: Action executed successfully. You have just collected a pickable plug. It is put into your bag. You may craft something new with it and other things in the bag, or apply it in the future.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.

Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small sub-task  
Install the lever you took from the cabinet into the empty slot of the power distribution box so the second circuit can be energized.

Why  
The box keeps telling us it needs another lever. Once installed, we should be able to supply power to the remaining parts of the facility (e.g., safety doors, fan, etc.), unlocking further progress.

How to achieve it  
From the current location (distribution box close-up) simply apply the lever to the power distribution box:

apply(lever, power distribution box)
Action: click(power distribution box)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on power distribution box. Try to find another lever to put on the slot.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Find out how to unlock the cabinet’s 4-digit combination lock (and, if possible, open it so we can take the iron lever).

Plan to achieve the sub-task  
1. Click the combination lock to see if it lets us input numbers or provides any additional hint.  
(The game usually shows a keypad or dialogue after clicking; we can then try candidate codes.)

Next action  
click(combination lock)
Action: click(combination lock)

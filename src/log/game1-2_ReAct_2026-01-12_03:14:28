Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Enter room 805 to start exploring its interior.

Plan to achieve it:
The door is already unlocked and has been clicked once, so the new interior scene should now be accessible. Simply move from the current “room 805 door view” scene into the room itself.

Proposed action (one step):
move(To room 805 interior)
Action: move(Back to the hallway right)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: hallway right.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Retrieve the code fragment inside the small cabinet (paper4).

Plan:
1. Since the cabinet door is now operable, simply pick up the note that’s visible inside.
2. Action: click(paper4)

This should add paper4 to our bag, giving us another piece of the 12-character code for the desk drawer.
Action: click(paper4)
Reward: Action executed successfully. You have just collected a paper4. It is put into your bag. You may craft something new with it and other things in the bag, or apply it in the future.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Try to open the safe hidden behind the anatomy poster.

Rationale  
• Lower-cabinet drawer clue: “1212 +”  
• Painting #2 clue: “150”  
Interpretation: 1212 + 150 = 1362 → a 4-digit number that fits the safe’s requirement.

Plan / Actions needed  
1. move(anatomy poster close-up) (from the current “operating room” scene).  
2. click(safe) and when the game asks for the 4-digit code, enter 1362.

If the code is correct, the safe should open and reveal new items or clues.
Action: move(To the anatomy poster close-up)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: anatomy poster close-up.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Attempt to open the hidden safe behind the anatomy poster.

Rationale: We’ve collected multiple numeric clues (1212 + from the lower-cabinet paper and 150 from the painting). Adding them gives 1362, a plausible 4-digit code. First we need to interact with the safe to reach its code-entry interface.

Planned action: click(safe)
Action: click(safe)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on safe. The safe is locked. you need to input the correct code to unlock it.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Try unlocking the safe with the 4-digit code we’ve deduced (1212 + 150 = 1362).  
Rationale: We found the two numerical hints “1212 +” (lower cabinet) and “150” (painting). Their sum gives a plausible 4-digit code, so the next logical step is to test 1362 on the safe.

Action: click(safe)
Action: apply(paper1, safe)
Reward: Nothing happens after you apply the tool. The safe is locked. you need to input the correct code to unlock it.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Try to unlock the safe behind the anatomy poster (we likely have collected enough hints to deduce its 4-digit code).

Rationale  
The paper found in the lower cabinet says “1212 +”.  
The painting in the 805 right room shows “150”.  
1212 + 150 = 1362 – a 4-digit number that perfectly fits the safe’s requirement.  
If correct, opening the safe should give us a new item or clue that will help with the remaining puzzles (padlock, ventilation fan, coded drawer, etc.).

Action sequence to carry out the subtask  
1. move(To the operating room cabinet close-up)      – back out of the lower cabinet view  
2. move(To the operating room)                       – return to the room itself  
3. move(To the anatomy poster close-up)              – face the safe  
4. click(safe)                                       – attempt to input “1362” and open it
Action: move(Back to the operating room cabinet close-up)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: operating room cabinet close-up.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Try powering the hallway ventilation fan with the battery to see if it reveals anything hidden.

Why: The fan is currently non-functional and the only obvious power source we possess is the battery. Activating the fan might expose a compartment or blow out an item.

How to achieve it:
1. move(To the hallway right) – leave the operating room.
2. move(To the ventilation fan close-up) – step to the fan.
3. apply(battery, ventilation fan) – attempt to power it.

If it works, observe the result; if it doesn’t, we’ll re-evaluate other uses for the battery.
Action: move(To the hallway right)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: hallway right.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Open the hidden safe behind the anatomy poster to retrieve its contents.

Rationale:
• From the lower-cabinet drawer we found the hint “1212 +”.  
• In the 805 right-room painting we saw the number “150”.  
• 1212 + 150 = 1362, which fits the 4-digit numeric requirement of the safe.  
Therefore, the safe’s code is likely 1362. Opening the safe will probably give us a new item that helps with the remaining puzzles (e.g., a step-stool for the fan, a drill body for the bit, etc.).

Plan to achieve the subtask:
1. Click the safe again; when the game prompts for the code, enter 1362.

Next action: click(safe)
Action: click(safe)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on safe. The safe is locked. you need to input the correct code to unlock it.

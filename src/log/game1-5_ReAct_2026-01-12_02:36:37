Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Collect the hose so we can later siphon oil from the drum (likely needed to supply energy).

Plan to achieve it:
1. Examine / pick up the hose in the stair scene.

Proposed next action:
click(hose)
Action: click(hose)
Reward: Action executed successfully. You have just collected a hose. It is put into your bag. You may craft something new with it and other things in the bag, or apply it in the future.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task: Unlock the iron box in the boiler room.

Rationale: Paper 1 (π) implies the code is the first four digits of pi.  
The box hint (“dot between the first and second digit”) matches “3.141”.  
Ignoring the dot gives 3141. Opening the iron box will likely yield a useful item.

How to carry it out:  
Perform click(iron box) and, when the game prompts for the 4-digit code, enter 3141.
Action: click(iron box)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on iron box. You need to input the correct password. pay attention to why there's a dot between the digits.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Retrieve “paper 1” (the math hint) from the stair to confirm the iron-box password clue.

Why: The iron box requires a 4-digit code with a dot after the first digit. The paper marked with a big π is almost certainly the intended hint. Having the paper in hand will solidify the clue before we attempt to unlock the box.

Plan:
1. Move from the boiler room to the stair (adjacent on the map).
2. Click paper 1 to pick it up.

Immediate next action:  
move(Go to the stair)
Action: move(Back to the stair)

Proposed_subtask: Proposed next subtask  
Fix the broken wire of the computer in the control room so it can be powered up and accept the disks we’ve collected.

How to achieve  
1. Leave the dormitory and head toward the control room (path: the dormitory → room on the right → initial room → room on the left → the control room).  
2. Once in front of the computer, apply the duct tape from the bag to the computer’s broken wire to repair it.

Immediate next action  
move(room on the right)
Action: click(vent pipe)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on vent pipe. You may need to get rid of the barbed wire first to get the thing inside.

Proposed_subtask: Next subtask  
Safely remove the barbed wire from the vent pipe so we can reach whatever is inside it.

Plan to achieve it  
Wrap the sharp barbs with something we have, making it safe to pull aside. The duct-tape in our bag is perfect for that. We will therefore try applying the duct-tape to the vent pipe.

Proposed next action  
apply(duct tape, vent pipe)
Action: apply(duct tape, vent pipe)
Reward: vent pipe indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. You may need to get rid of the barbed wire first to get the thing inside.

Proposed_subtask: Next small subtask: Start repairing the computer in the control room by first heading toward it.

How to achieve the subtask
1. From the dormitory, move to the room on the right (the only direct exit).
2. From there, continue through the initial room → room on the left → the control room.
3. Once in the control room, apply the duct tape to the computer to mend its broken wire, then we’ll be able to plug it in afterward.

Execute first step now:

Action: move(room on the right)
Action: move(Back to room on the right)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: room on the right.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Reach the control room so we can try to repair the computer’s broken wire.

Plan:
1. Move from the “initial room” to “room on the left” (adjacent).
2. From “room on the left” move into “the control room”.

We’ll then attempt to fix the computer wire (likely with the duct tape) once we arrive.

Action: move(room on the left)
Action: move(Go to room on the left)

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: get the computer in the control room working by fixing its broken power cord.

Plan to accomplish the sub-task
1. From the current scene (room on the left) move to the control room (they are directly connected).

2. Once in the control room, try to supply power to the computer:
   – First attempt: apply the pickable plug to the computer; if the plug can be attached it will restore the connection.  
     Action: apply(pickable plug, computer)

(If that fails, the follow-up would be to try taping the plug/wire with duct tape, but the immediate next small step is the attempt above.)

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Try to power-up the computer.

Plan: The computer’s only problem mentioned is its broken wire. The “pickable plug” is specifically for connecting electric devices to a power source, so the first thing to try is attaching that plug to the computer. If that doesn’t completely fix it, we can try taping the wire afterward, but the logical first step is to plug it in.

Next action: apply(pickable plug, computer)
Action: apply(pickable plug, computer)
Reward: computer indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. The wire is broken. fix it first.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

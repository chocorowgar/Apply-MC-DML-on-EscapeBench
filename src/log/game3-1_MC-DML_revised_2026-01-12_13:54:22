Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Explore the “crane overview” area to discover new interactable items or tools that might help us reach the dagger or unlock the garbage bin.

How to achieve it:
1. Walk from “warehouse outside” directly to “crane overview” (they are adjacent in the map).
2. Once there, list and examine every interactable object.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Unlock and open the green garbage bin.

Plan to achieve it
1. Move from “warehouse outside” to “garbage disposal place” (they are directly connected on the map).
2. Apply the silver key (in bag) to the locked lid of the green garbage bin to open it and discover its contents.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Inspect the switches inside the now-opened electric box to find out what they control (and possibly flip the correct one to unlock/energise something).

How to achieve  
First step is to get inside the “electric box inside” scene where the switches are located.

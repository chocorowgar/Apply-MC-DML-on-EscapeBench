Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small sub-task  
Sub-task: Check the crane now that its power switch (A03) is ON. First step is to leave the corner and get back outside.

Why: Turning switch A03 should have energized the crane. The crane overview area may now contain new active controls or lowered equipment that can help us (e.g., reach the dagger, open the garbage bin, etc.).

How to achieve the sub-task  
Path to “crane overview”:  
warehouse door corner  →  warehouse outside  →  crane overview  
We begin by moving to the adjacent scene “warehouse outside”.

Next game action  
move(warehouse outside)
Action: move(Back to the warehouse outside)

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Operate the crane again to look for (or create) a way to reach the dagger on the hydrant sign.

Why: The dagger is currently too high to grab. Now that the crane is powered on and lifting, additional crane controls or a shifted load may let us position something we can climb on, or supply a hook/chain we can use to pull the dagger down.

How to achieve it:
1. Move from “warehouse outside” to “crane overview”.
2. Once there, examine / click the crane or any newly visible crane parts until we find a way to reposition its load or lower its hook toward the hydrant sign area.

Immediate next action:  
move(Explore the crane in the front)

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Retrieve the dagger that is stuck high in the hydrant sign.

Why: The dagger is likely useful either as a lever or as a cutting/piercing tool, and our long, thin chisel can help dislodge it.

Plan:
1. Move from the current scene (garbage disposal place) back to “warehouse outside”.
2. Use the long chisel as a levering/prying tool on the dagger to knock or pry it loose.

Immediate next action: 
move(warehouse outside)
Action: move(Back to the warehouse outside)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: warehouse outside.

Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Open the locked cabinet in the left hallway with the gold key

Rationale
• The cabinet lock in the left hallway shows the same yellow-bolt symbol that is on the gold key we just found, so the key is very likely meant for that lock.  
• To reach the cabinet we must travel: shelves region overview → middle hallway → warehouse leftside overview → left hallway.

Immediate next step
move(middle hallway)

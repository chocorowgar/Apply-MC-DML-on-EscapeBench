Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Examine the small cabinet door more closely to understand how it might be opened.

Plan to achieve it:
1. Click on the “small cabinet door” to look for additional details—perhaps a hidden latch, screw holes for a handle, or anything that hints at what tool/part we need.

Proposed next game command:
click(small cabinet door)
Action: apply(paper1, small cabinet door)
Reward: small cabinet door indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. It looks like you have to first ensemble a handle to open the cabinet.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Thought:
We still need more clues for the 12-character code lock in the desk drawer.  In the “805 right room” there are two paintings we haven’t examined yet; one of them already hints it shows “150”.  These paintings may hide or contain more code fragments.  A small, safe subtask is therefore to inspect one of the paintings closely.

Next Subtask:
Examine painting 2 in the 805 right room to look for any hidden details or additional code fragments.

Plan to achieve the subtask:
1. Move from room 805 to “805 right room” (they are directly connected).
2. Click on “painting2” to inspect it.

Action:
move(To the right part of the room)
Action: move(To the right part of the room)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: 805 right room.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Examine the ventilation fan more closely to find out why it is not working or if it can be opened.

Action: click(ventilation fan)
Action: apply(battery, ventilation fan)
Reward: ventilation fan indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. The fan is mounted too high. you need something to reach it.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Proposed next small subtask: Enter and explore the operating room now that the door has been unlocked.

How to achieve the subtask:
Since the keycard has already been applied to the operating-room door, try stepping through the door from the current “operating room door overview” scene. Moving into the operating room should reveal a new scene and any new interactable items inside.

Planned action:  
move(To the operating room)
Action: move(Back to the hallway right)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: hallway right.

You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Open the small cabinet by installing the handle.

Plan to accomplish it
1. Navigate to the small-cabinet scene.
   • anatomy poster close-up → operating room → hallway right → small cabinet close-up  
     (follow the edges in the map).

2. Once in “small cabinet close-up”, use the handle you just obtained.
   • apply(door handle, small cabinet door)

Expected result  
The handle should let the cabinet door open so you can look inside and collect whatever is there.
Action: move(Back to the operating room)

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Collect the paper inside the small cabinet.

Plan to achieve:
1. We’re already at “small cabinet close-up,” and the only interactable here is “paper4.”
2. Click on “paper4” to take/examine it and hopefully add it to our bag.

Proposed next action:
click(paper4)
Action: click(paper4)
Reward: Action executed successfully. You have just collected a paper4. It is put into your bag. You may craft something new with it and other things in the bag, or apply it in the future.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Try to open the safe behind the anatomy poster.

Rationale: We have two numeric hints:
• “1212 +” (from the lower‐cabinet paper piece)  
• “150” (from the painting that shows the number 150)  
Adding them suggests the 4-digit code 1212 + 150 = 1362.  
We should attempt to enter 1362 on the safe to see if it unlocks.

Planned action: click(safe)
Action: click(safe)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on safe. The safe is locked. you need to input the correct code to unlock it.

Proposed_subtask: Proposed next sub-task  
Attempt to unlock the safe behind the anatomy poster by trying the 4-digit code “1362” (1212 + 150).  

Why  
We already collected the hint “1212 +” from the lower cabinet and saw the number “150” on a painting. Their sum yields a plausible 4-digit code, which is likely meant for the safe. Opening the safe should give us new items or clues needed for further progress.  

How to perform the sub-task  
1. click(safe) – this should bring up the code-input interface.  
2. If the game immediately asks for a code after the click, enter 1362. (In this interface the game may automatically evaluate the attempt.)
Action: click(safe)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on safe. The safe is locked. you need to input the correct code to unlock it.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Thoughts: I still need a number-based clue for the 4-digit safe. The slip “1212 +” suggests I’m supposed to add something to 1212. Painting 2 already gave “150”; painting 1 may hide the other addend. First, I have to get back to the room with the paintings.

Next small subtask: Closely inspect painting 1 in the 805 right room to see if it reveals a number or other code clue.

Planned steps:
1. From hallway right go to room 805.
2. From room 805 enter the 805 right room.
3. Click on painting 1 to examine it carefully.

Immediate action: move(To room 805)
Action: move(To room 805)

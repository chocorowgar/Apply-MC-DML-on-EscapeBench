You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).

Proposed_subtask: Next subtask  
Take another look at the dagger that is stuck in the hydrant sign; maybe a closer inspection will reveal a way (or a clue) to get it down.

Plan to reach and examine the dagger  
1. Leave the electric-box room back to “warehouse door corner”.  
2. From there move to “warehouse outside”.  
3. Click the “dagger inserted in sign” to examine it once more.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Retrieve the dagger from the hydrant sign – we’ll first return to the warehouse outside so we can try knocking the dagger loose with the hammer.

How to achieve  
1. Move from the current scene (warehouse door corner) back to “warehouse outside”.  
2. Once there, apply the hammer to the “dagger inserted in sign” to try to dislodge it.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Retrieve the dagger from the hydrant sign.  
Rationale: The dagger is likely a useful tool for picking locks or prying things open (e.g., garbage-bin lid, warehouse door). It’s out of reach by hand, but the hammer can be used to knock or lever it loose.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Re-check the electric switch box and look for a switch that unlocks or powers the green warehouse door. If such a switch exists, toggle it to open the door.

Plan to achieve the sub-task  
1. Walk from the “warehouse door corner” into the “electric box inside” scene (they are directly connected).  
2. Examine / click the switches or control panel again; compare any labels with the circuit diagram in the bag (A-numbers).  
3. If a switch related to the exit/warehouse door is present (likely A09 or A13), toggle it.  
4. Return to the warehouse door to see whether it is now unlocked.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Retrieve the dagger that is stuck high in the hydrant sign.

Reasoning: The dagger is out of arm’s reach, but we can use the hammer’s long handle/head to knock or pry it loose. If successful, we’ll gain a new tool (the dagger) that may work as a key or prying device elsewhere.

Planned action:
apply(hammer, dagger inserted in sign)
Action: apply(hammer, dagger inserted in sign)
Reward: dagger inserted in sign indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. You may try to use something to get it down

Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task  
Try to open the locked garbage bin – it may contain a useful key or item.

Plan to achieve it  
1. From the current scene “warehouse door corner” move back to “warehouse outside”.  
2. From “warehouse outside” move to “garbage disposal place”.  
3. Apply the hammer to the green garbage bin to smash or pry off the lock.

Immediate next action (step 1 of the plan):  
move(Back to the warehouse outside)
Action: move(Back to the warehouse outside)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: warehouse outside.

You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Retrieve the dagger that is stuck high in the hydrant sign. It may serve as a useful tool or key.

How to achieve:
1. Go back outside the warehouse where the hydrant sign is.
2. Use the hammer to knock the dagger loose and pick it up.

Immediate next action (step 1 of the plan):
move(warehouse outside)
Action: move(Back to the warehouse outside)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: warehouse outside.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Retrieve the dagger from the hydrant sign – it may serve as a useful tool or key for later locks.

Plan to achieve the sub-task  
Since the dagger is stuck in the metal sign, the hammer’s metal head could be used to knock it loose. Although it is “too high to reach with hands,” striking the sign with the hammer’s claw end may dislodge the dagger so it can fall and be picked up.

Next game action  
apply(hammer, dagger inserted in sign)
Action: apply(hammer, dagger inserted in sign)
Reward: dagger inserted in sign indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. You may try to use something to get it down

Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Reach the electric box again so we can try using the circuit diagram on it and possibly energise / unlock the warehouse door.  

Plan to accomplish it:  
1. From the current scene (warehouse outside) move to “warehouse door corner”.  
2. From “warehouse door corner” move to “electric box inside”.  

First step (one small action now):  
move(Back to the corner of the warehouse)
Action: move(Go to the door in left corner)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: warehouse door corner.

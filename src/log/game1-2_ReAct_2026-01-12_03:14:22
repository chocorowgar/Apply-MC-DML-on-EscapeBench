Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Inspect the bedside drawer to learn more about its 3-digit lock (look for clues about the required code or see if the lock can be interacted with further).

Planned steps:  
1. Examine the drawer up close; sometimes a closer look reveals scratches, stickers, or other hints about the code.  
2. Note anything that might help determine the 3-digit combination.

Action to execute now:  
click(bedside drawer)
Action: click(bedside drawer)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on bedside drawer. You need to input the correct 3-digit code to open it. try to use 3-digit hint you got.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask
Open the small cabinet by attaching the door handle, so we can see what’s inside.

Plan to achieve the subtask
1. move(To the small cabinet close-up) – it is directly connected to hallway right.
2. apply(door handle, small cabinet door) – this should install the handle and (likely) open or allow us to open the cabinet.

I will begin with step 1.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Reach the safe behind the anatomy poster so we can try the suspected 4-digit code (1212 + 150 = 1362).

Plan
1. Move from the current scene (ventilation fan close-up) to “hallway right”.
2. Move from “hallway right” to “operating room”.
3. Move from “operating room” to “anatomy poster close-up”.
4. Click the safe and, if prompted, enter 1362.

First step to start this chain:

Action: move(hallway right)
Action: apply(paper1, ventilation fan)
Reward: ventilation fan indeed needs a tool to apply but the current tool is wrong. You should try other tools or gather other clues first.
Nothing happens after you apply the tool. The fan is mounted too high. you need something to reach it.

Proposed_subtask: Subtask  
Take a closer look at painting2 in the “805 right room” to see if it hides anything else besides the visible “150”.

Plan to achieve the subtask  
1. move(To the 805 right room) – this room is directly connected to the hallway right.  
2. click(painting2) – inspect it carefully; there might be more information or an item hidden behind/inside it.

If new clues or items are revealed we can decide on the next action accordingly.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Examine painting2 in the 805 right room to obtain any clue it hides (possibly a code for the anatomy-poster safe).

Steps to achieve the sub-task
1. move(To the 805 right room) – from our current location “room 805”.
2. click(painting2) – inspect the painting that shows the number “150”.

This will reveal whether the “150” itself or something behind/within the painting is useful for the 4-digit safe code or other puzzles.

Proposed_subtask: Next subtask: Examine painting2 in the 805 right room to see if it provides a clue or a hidden item.

Plan to achieve the subtask:
1. move(Back to room 805) – from the desk close-up back to the main area of room 805.  
2. move(To the 805 right room) – enter the section with the paintings.  
3. click(painting2) – inspect the painting showing “150”.

This is a small, self-contained step that could supply another hint or item for either the 12-character drawer code or the 4-digit safe code.
Action: move(Back to the room 805)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: room 805.

Considering the Current State, your previous actions and reward, propose the next subtask, and how to achieve the subtask, the next subtask should be small.
You can perform one of the following actions:
- click(<interactable item>): Click an <interactable item> to examine it or interact with it. For example, you can examine a door handle that is marked as interactable. You cannot click tools in bag.
- apply(<applicable tool>, <interactable item>): Apply an <applicable tool> in your bag to an <interactable item>. For example, you can apply a key in your bag to an interactable locked door to open it.
- move(<interactable scene>): Move to a nearby <interactable item> to further explore. For example, you can move to the living room to explore more interactable items there.
- craft(<applicable tool>, <applicable tool>): Use one <applicable tool> in bag to another <applicable tool> in bag to craft something new. For example, you can use a battery in bag to a controller in bag to craft a new charged controller.
**Note** If you decide to move to another scene, you have to plan the path from your current scene to destination scene based on Map of Scenes (edge list).
Proposed_subtask: Subtask: Try to open the 4-digit safe behind the anatomy poster.

Why: We now have two numerical clues—
 • “1212 +” (from the lower cabinet)  
 • “150” (from painting2)  

1212 + 150 = 1362, which is a plausible 4-digit code for the safe. If the safe opens we may gain another paper piece or a new tool for later puzzles.

Plan / actions to perform the subtask:
1. move(To the hallway right)        – room 805 → hallway right  
2. move(To the operating room)        – hallway right → operating room  
3. move(To the anatomy poster close-up) – operating room → anatomy poster close-up  
4. click(safe)                        – attempt to open it; when prompted, enter 1362  

If 1362 works, collect whatever is inside; if not, we’ll re-evaluate.
Action: move(To the hallway right)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: hallway right.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Examine painting2 (the painting that displays “150”) to see if there is any hidden information or compartment that may provide another clue or paper piece.

Plan to achieve it:
1. While staying in the current scene (805 right room), closely inspect painting2.
2. If it can be moved or opened, note down anything revealed (numbers, papers, keys, etc.).

Action: click(painting2)
Action: click(painting2)
Reward: Nothing happens after clicking on painting2. It could be a hint for something.

Proposed_subtask: Next small subtask  
Finish inserting all the coded paper pieces into the desk drawer so the 12-character lock can finally be solved.

Step-by-step plan  
1. From 805 right room move back to “room 805”.  
2. Move from “room 805” to “desk close-up”.  
3. Apply paper3 to the drawer with code lock.  
4. Apply paper4 to the drawer with code lock.

If the drawer still indicates it needs more, we’ll know additional papers are required; otherwise it should unlock or expose the code entry mechanism.
Action: move(Back to the room 805)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: room 805.

Proposed_subtask: Next sub-task  
Lubricate and open the rusty padlock on the corridor cabinet to find what’s inside.

Plan to achieve it  
1. Leave the desk area and return to the corridor cabinet.  
   • move(room 805) → move(hallway right) → move(hallway) → move(cabinet close-up)  
2. Once at the cabinet close-up, apply the lubricant to the padlock.  
   • apply(lubricant, padlock)

Expected result  
The lubricant should free the mechanism so the padlock can be opened, giving access to the cabinet’s contents and possibly new tools or clues.
Action: move(Back to the room 805)
Reward: Action executed successfully. Change to another scene: room 805.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task: Loosen the rusty padlock on the cabinet so it can be opened.

Why: The padlock was described as “jammed and rusty”; we now have a bottle of lubricant that is perfect for freeing it.

How to achieve:
1. move(cabinet close-up)   – from the hallway, step up to the cabinet.
2. apply(lubricant, padlock) – squirt the lubricant into the rusty mechanism.

If successful we can then try clicking or unlocking the padlock to open the cabinet in a following step.

Proposed_subtask: Sub-task  
Lubricate the jammed padlock so it can be opened.

How to achieve  
1. apply(lubricant, padlock) – squirt the lubricant into the rusty mechanism.  
(If that succeeds, the follow-up step would be to click the padlock to open the cabinet.)

I will start with step 1.
